# Minting Diamonds

The minting process in the Diamond Platform refers to the creation of unique Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) that represent ownership of physical diamonds.

This process transforms diamonds into digital assets that can be traded, bought, and sold on the platform and other marketplaces. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the minting process:

1. #### Diamond verification

The diamond owner initiates the minting process by verifying their diamond. They use the minting interface on the DNXT platform to submit the required information and documents for verification.

2. #### KYC/AML check

The diamond owner's identity and information are verified by the KYC/AML system to ensure compliance with regulations and prevent fraud. The platform may use an external KYC/AML provider for this purpose.

3. #### Minting request

Once the diamond owner's identity and diamond information are verified, a minting request is sent to the Mint / Redeem Platform. This request includes the details of the diamond, such as its characteristics, images, and ownership information.

4. #### NFT creation

The Diamond NFT smart contract creates a unique NFT for the verified diamond, assigning it a unique token ID and linking it to the diamond owner's wallet address. This NFT represents the digital ownership of the physical diamond.

5. #### Listing on the marketplace

Once the NFT is minted, it can be listed on the Rarible Marketplace or other supported marketplaces for trading, buying, or selling. The diamond owner can set the price and other parameters for the listing.
