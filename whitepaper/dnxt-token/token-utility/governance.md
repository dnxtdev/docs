# Governance

DNXT token holders have the power to participate in the platform's governance. They can propose and vote on changes to the platform's parameters, future developments, and improvements. The more DNXT tokens a user holds, the greater their influence on the platform's governance decisions. This ensures that the DNFT Platform remains community-driven and evolves according to the needs and preferences of its users.
