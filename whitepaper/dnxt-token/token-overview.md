# Token overview

### Token Overview

The DNXT token is a utility and security token at the core of the DiamondNXT ecosystem. It is designed to provide utility within the platform and facilitate the secure, compliant trading of diamond NFTs. The DNXT token serves multiple purposes, such as enabling trading, staking, redeeming, and governance.

As a security token, the DNXT token incorporates regulatory compliance measures, including Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks, to ensure that the DNXT platform operates within the bounds of applicable laws and regulations. The platform utilizes the OpenZeppelin Defender to enhance the security and management of the DNXT token smart contracts. The Defender is a security-focused platform that offers a suite of tools to help developers build, manage, and monitor secure smart contracts.

By incorporating KYC and AML checks, the DNXT token ensures that only verified and compliant users can participate in the DiamondNXT ecosystem. These measures not only foster a secure and trusted environment for users but also help to prevent illicit activities, such as money laundering and terrorist financing, from infiltrating the platform.

The DNXT token serves as the foundation of the DiamondNXT ecosystem, providing a secure, compliant, and versatile means of facilitating transactions and interactions within the platform.
