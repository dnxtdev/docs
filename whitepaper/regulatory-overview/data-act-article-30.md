description: Essential requirements regarding smart contracts for data sharing

# Data Act Article 30

Based on the requirements mentioned in the [Data Act](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2023-0069\_EN.html) Article 30 , it is essential for the DNXT platform to ensure compliance with these regulations when offering smart contracts for data sharing. Here's a brief overview of how the DNXT platform can address these requirements:

(a) **Robustness and access control:** The DNXT platform will implement robust access control mechanisms by integrating secure authentication and authorization protocols. Role-based access control (RBAC) can be employed to ensure that only authorized users can execute specific actions on the smart contracts. Additionally, security audits and penetration testing should be conducted regularly to ensure the platform's resilience against functional errors and manipulation attempts.

(b) **Safe termination and interruption:** The smart contracts used by the DNXT platform will include built-in functions for safe termination and interruption. These functions can be triggered under predefined conditions, which will be clearly outlined in the smart contract code and documentation. The platform should also consider implementing an emergency stop or circuit breaker mechanism, which allows for the suspension of smart contract execution in exceptional circumstances.

(ba) **Equivalence:** The DNXT platform will ensure that its smart contracts offer the same level of protection and legal certainty as traditional contracts. This includes using clear and unambiguous language in the smart contract code, ensuring enforceability, and providing a dispute resolution mechanism for any disagreements that may arise.

(bb) **Protection of confidentiality of trade secrets:** The DNXT platform will incorporate privacy-preserving technologies and encryption mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of trade secrets. Sensitive data will be stored securely, and access to such data will be strictly controlled. The platform will also adhere to data protection regulations, ensuring the security and privacy of users' data.

By adhering to these essential requirements, the DNXT platform can ensure regulatory compliance and provide a trustworthy environment for users to engage in data sharing through smart contracts.
