# Staking system

The staking system on the DNXT platform allows users to stake their DNXT tokens to earn rewards, access discounts on the redeem process, and participate in governance decisions. Here's an overview of the staking process:

1. **Connecting Wallet**: To interact with the staking system, users first need to connect their Ethereum wallet, which holds the DNXT tokens, to the platform using the wallet connection interface.
2. **Staking Interface**: Users can access the staking interface on the DNXT platform to manage their staked DNXT tokens. The interface displays the current staking balance, earned rewards, and available staking options.
3. **Staking DNXT Tokens**: Users can stake their DNXT tokens by selecting the desired amount and duration. Users must approve the DNXT token transfer to the staking smart contract.
4. **Smart Contract Interaction**: The staking interface interacts with the Staking System smart contract, which locks the staked DNXT tokens.
5. **Earning Rewards**: Stakers earn rewards in the form of additional DNXT tokens, which are distributed periodically based on the staking duration and amount. The rewards are calculated using a predefined formula set by the smartcontract.
6. **Claiming Rewards**: Users can claim their earned rewards through the staking interface. The claimed rewards are sent to the user's Ethereum wallet and can be used for trading, redeem discounts, or further staking.
7. **Unstaking**: Users can unstake their DNXT tokens. The unstaked tokens, along with any unclaimed rewards, are returned to the user's Ethereum wallet.

The staking system on the DNXT platform offers various benefits to DNXT token holders, including earning rewards and accessing redeem discounts.
