# Redeeming Process

The Diamond NFT redeem process allows NFT owners to exchange their Diamond NFTs for the corresponding physical diamonds, effectively reversing the minting process. Here's an overview of the process:

1. **NFT Ownership Verification**: The NFT owner submits a redemption request through the Redeem Interface on the DNXT platform. The system verifies the ownership of the Diamond NFT by checking the Ethereum wallet address associated with the NFT.
2. **Redemption Fee Payment**: The NFT owner needs to pay a redemption fee in DNXT tokens to cover the cost of retrieving and delivering the physical diamond. Staking DNXT tokens on the platform can provide a discount on the redemption fee.
3. **Smart Contract Interaction**: The Redeem Interface interacts with the Redeem smart contract, which locks the Diamond NFT and initiates the redemption process.
4. **Admin Notification**: The DNXT platform administrators are notified of the redemption request and begin coordinating the diamond retrieval and delivery.
5. **Physical Diamond Retrieval**: The physical diamond is retrieved from the trusted custodian and prepared for delivery to the NFT owner.
6. **Shipping Details Verification**: The NFT owner must provide accurate shipping details, including a valid address and any necessary customs information.
7. **Diamond Shipment**: The diamond is shipped to the NFT owner, with tracking information provided to monitor the delivery progress.
8. **NFT Burning**: Once the diamond has been successfully delivered and the NFT owner confirms receipt, the locked Diamond NFT is burned by the platform administrators via the Diamond NFT smart contract. This ensures that the NFT is permanently removed from circulation.

By following these steps, the Diamond NFT redeem process allows NFT owners to exchange their unique digital assets for the corresponding physical diamonds, providing a valuable exit strategy for those who wish to reclaim the tangible asset.
