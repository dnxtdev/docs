# Smart Contracts

### Smart Contracts

#### Diamond NFT

The Diamond NFT smart contract is responsible for the creation, management, and tracking of diamond NFTs within the DNXT ecosystem. It handles the minting of new diamond NFTs when diamonds are verified and approved and the burning of diamond NFTs during the redemption process.

#### DNXT Token

The DNXT Token smart contract governs the creation, distribution, and management of the platform's native utility token, DNXT. It defines the tokenomics of DNXT, including its allocation and distribution. DNXT tokens can be used for staking rewards, redeeming discounts, and participating in governance.

#### Staking System

The Staking System smart contract allows users to stake their DNXT tokens in return for rewards and benefits, such as discounts on redeeming diamonds. It also enables users to participate in governance decisions by staking their tokens.

#### Redeem

The Redeem smart contract handles the process of redeeming diamond NFTs for physical diamonds. Users can lock and burn their diamond NFTs and pay the necessary DNXT tokens to redeem their diamonds. The contract also interfaces with the Staking System to provide discounts for users who have staked DNXT tokens.

#### Whitelist Verifier

The Whitelist Verifier smart contract ensures that only approved users can interact with the DNXT platform. It checks the user's KYC/AML status and whether they are on a whitelist or blacklist before allowing them to participate in the platform.
