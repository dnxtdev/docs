# DNXT

This smart contract, DiamondNXT, is an ERC20 token implementation that incorporates several features, such as burnability, pausability, access control, ERC20Permit (off-chain approvals), ERC20Votes (token-based governance), and whitelist verification. Let's analyze the key components of this contract:

1. Inheritance: The contract inherits from several OpenZeppelin contracts, which provide industry-standard implementations of the ERC20 token and its additional features.
2. PAUSER\_ROLE: A constant variable is declared to store the keccak256 hash of the string "PAUSER\_ROLE", which will be used as an identifier for the pauser role in the AccessControl contract.
3. Constructor: The constructor initializes the ERC20 token with its name, symbol, and initial supply. It also sets the initial admin and pauser roles to the account that deploys the contract (msg.sender). Lastly, it initializes the WhitelistVerifier contract with the provided `_whitelist` address.
4. addPauser and removePauser: These functions allow the admin role to add or remove accounts with the pauser role.
5. \_beforeTokenTransfer: This function is overridden from the ERC20 contract to check if the addresses involved in the token transfer (both sender and recipient) are whitelisted. The transfer will only proceed if both addresses are whitelisted.
6. pause and unpause: These functions allow the pauser role to pause or unpause the contract. When the contract is paused, token transfers are not allowed.
7. Overridden functions: The contract overrides several functions from the inherited contracts, such as `_afterTokenTransfer`, `_mint`, and `_burn`. These overrides are necessary to properly combine the functionality of the inherited contracts (ERC20Votes in particular).

In summary, the DiamondNXT contract is an ERC20 token with additional features such as burnability, pausability, governance, and whitelist verification. The contract utilizes OpenZeppelin's library of secure and tested implementations for these features, ensuring a high level of security and functionality.
